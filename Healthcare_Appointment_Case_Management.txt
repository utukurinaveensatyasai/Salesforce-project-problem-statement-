Problem Statement: Salesforce-based Healthcare Appointment & Case Management System

Objective:
Develop a Salesforce application that streamlines patient appointment booking, case management, and hospital performance tracking using Salesforce Service Cloud and Health Cloud features.

Requirements:

1. Patient Management
   - Patients can register and update their profiles (personal details, medical history, contact info).
   - Patients can securely log in to book and manage appointments.

2. Appointment Scheduling
   - Patients can request appointments by selecting preferred date, time, and doctor specialization.
   - System should automatically assign doctors based on specialization, availability, and workload.

3. Case Management
   - Each appointment generates a case that stores patient concerns, diagnosis, and treatment details.
   - Doctors and hospital staff can update case records with progress notes and prescriptions.
   - Escalation rules for critical cases.

4. Notifications & Communication
   - Patients receive automated notifications (email/SMS) for appointment confirmation, reminders, and updates.
   - Doctors are notified of assigned appointments.

5. Reports & Dashboards
   - Hospital administrators can view reports on:
       * Number of appointments by department/doctor.
       * Average appointment resolution time.
       * Patient satisfaction trends (through feedback surveys).
       * Performance of doctors and hospital staff.

Expected Deliverables:
- A Salesforce application with custom objects, workflows, and automation.
- Implementation of appointment and case management using Service Cloud/Health Cloud.
- Reports and dashboards for hospital performance monitoring.

Outcome:
A scalable, real-world healthcare solution that enhances patient experience, improves hospital operations, and showcases expertise in Salesforce customization and automation.
